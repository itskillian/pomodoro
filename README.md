### Pomodoro Timer
I was inspired by the concept of Pomodoro timers as a tool for increasing productivity and improving learning retention, so I decided to build my own pomodoro app.

This project is a showcase of building a project with Nextjs and Reactjs, exploring the complexities of tools like useState and local storage to create a dynamic timer and seamless user experience. The design of the frontend lends to the functionality of the timer, I aimed to reduce user distraction and display a clear UI, with only the essential information.

## Tech used
